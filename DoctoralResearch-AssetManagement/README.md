# Doctoral Research in Asset Management (Scripts/R)

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to data cleaning and processing, essential for researching US mutual funds. It contains sub-repositories, each with specific codes and explanations. The focus here is on fundamental processes necessary for asset management research, although the repository allows for further exploration and customization based on individual research needs.

## Key Aspects of the Repository

R Scripts with Detailed Commentary**: Central to this repository are R scripts, each thoroughly commented on and explained. They are crafted to assist researchers in navigating the complexities of data compilation and integration from diverse sources such as CRSP, Thomson Reuters, and Morningstar.

### Folders

- **Data Matching**: A critical component of this repository is the `Data Matching` folder. It includes scripts for merging and harmonizing data from various sources, adhering to high data management standards, and ensuring consistency and accuracy.

- **Fund-Level Aggregation**: The `FundLevel Aggregation` folder contains scripts for aggregating data at the fund level. These scripts use value-weighting procedures essential for precise fund performance analysis.

- **Portfolio Holdings MCU**: This section addresses the complexities of dealing with portfolio holdings from multiple sources. It guides the cleaning and processing of portfolio holdings data, setting the foundation for subsequent calculations or analyses.

## Data Handling and Ethics

- **Data Licensing and Structure Insight**: The data used in these scripts is licensed, and actual datasets cannot be provided. However, insights into the data structure, variable names, and example structures are offered to assist in understanding and visualizing the codeâ€™s application.

## Responsibility of Use

- **Acquisition of Data**: The onus of acquiring the original data lies with the script user. All code provided should be used strictly with legitimately obtained data. Please get in touch with me at [carr8824@gmail.com](mailto:carr8824@gmail.com) for any questions or clarifications.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for researchers in asset management, providing essential tools and information for practical data analysis.
