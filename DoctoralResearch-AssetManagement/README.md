# (Scripts/R) Doctoral Research in Asset Management

## Overview
## Key Aspects of the Repository:

- **R Scripts with Detailed Commentary**: The repository primarily hosts R scripts, each meticulously commented and explained. These scripts are designed to guide you through the complexities of compiling and matching data from multiple sources.

- **Data Matching**: One of the repository's focal points is the `Data Matching` folder. Here, you'll find scripts tailored for integrating data from CRSP, Thomson Reuters, and Morningstar, adhering to established standards in data management.

- **Fund-Level Aggregation**: In the `FundLevel Aggregation` folder, the repository provides scripts for aggregating share classes at the fund level using value-weighting procedures. This segment is crucial for accurate fund performance analysis.

## Data Handling and Ethics:

It's important to note that the data underlying these scripts is licensed, and I cannot provide any actual data sets. However, I offer an insight into the structure and names of the variables you will encounter in public datasets, along with example structures to help visualize the code's functionality.

## Responsibility of Use:

The responsibility of acquiring original data rests with the user of these scripts. The provided code should be applied exclusively to legitimately obtained data. For further inquiries or clarifications, please contact me at [carr8824@gmail.com](mailto:carr8824@gmail.com).
