# Data Cleaning and Processing

## Introduction

Since starting my journey as a research assistant in 2014, I have extensively engaged in research across various institutions, using data to conduct causal analyses and predict financial behaviors and market trends. My experience spans social science and finance, with a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics.

## Importance of Data Cleaning

- **Foundation of Analysis**: Before delving into any research, it's crucial to understand that data integrity is paramount. Inaccurate or unclean data can lead to erroneous conclusions. Therefore, rigorous data cleaning is the first step in any analytical process.

- **Exploring Data Structure**: A thorough exploration of data structure is necessary. This includes assessing missing information, conducting summary statistics, identifying outliers, and scrutinizing data for illogical values.

- **Understanding Data Limitations**: Recognizing your data's limitations and potential issues is vital. The quality and distribution of your data significantly influence the conclusions drawn from your analysis. Awareness of these aspects is crucial before proceeding with any further analysis.

## Repository: Data-Cleaning

- **Project-Specific Folders**: The `Data-Cleaning` repository comprises various folders, each corresponding to different research projects I have independently conducted. These projects reflect my intellectual development and personal contributions to the field.

- **Authorship and Legal Considerations**: All the coding and methodologies in these folders are my work. While I have collaborated on other projects, I have chosen not to include those in this repository to avoid legal issues with coauthors.

- **Focus on Asset Management Research**: This repository's primary focus is Research in Asset Management, which has been the cornerstone of my doctoral research. The data-cleaning processes applied here are among the most comprehensive and crucial for my academic work.

This repository is a testament to my dedication to rigorous data analysis and commitment to contributing valuable insights into finance and economics.
